00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:19,090
It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,604
and I suddenly realized

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,058
that the next day was Mother's Day,

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,904
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

6
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,305
so I started thinking about

7
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:30,642
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

8
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:32,486
I thought, why don't I make her

9
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:35,535
an interactive Mother's Day card

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,243
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

11
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:42,060
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,440
We developed it so that people could easily create
their own interactive stories and games and animations,

13
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:53,453
and then share their creations with one another.

14
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:57,321
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch
to make an interactive card for my mom.

15
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,397
Before making my own Mother's Day card,

16
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,382
I thought I would take a look

17
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:05,955
at the Scratch website.

18
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:09,313
So over the last several years, kids around the world

19
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:12,507
ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,

20
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:15,942
and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,
whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

21
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,321
So in the search box I typed in

22
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,866
"Mother's Day,"

23
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,869
and I was surprised and delighted to see a list

24
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,573
of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards

25
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:32,087
that showed up on the Scratch website,

26
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,405
many of them just in the past 24 hours

27
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:37,611
by procrastinators just like myself.

28
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,733
So I started taking a look at them. (Music)

29
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,189
I saw one of them that featured a kitten
and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,591
And the creator very considerately
offered a replay for her mom.

31
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,479
Another one was an interactive project where,

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,677
when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"

33
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:06,597
it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.
(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,239
about how she had Googled to find out

35
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,356
when Mother's Day was happening.

36
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:20,499
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,

37
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,977
she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting

38
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,604
of how much she loved her mom.

39
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,829
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects

40
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,481
and interacting with these projects.

41
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:34,322
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,

42
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:39,076
I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)

43
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,656
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

44
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:44,041
She wrote back to me and she said,

45
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,308
"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software

46
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:51,420
that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,220
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,844
but actually I was even happier for another reason.

49
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:03,803
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch

50
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,604
just in the way that we had hoped that they would.

51
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,415
As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,
you could see that they were really

52
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:15,008
becoming fluent with new technologies.

53
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,471
What do I mean by fluent?

54
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:20,503
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
and to start expressing their ideas.

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,934
When you become fluent with language,

56
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:29,471
it means you can write an entry in your journal

57
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:33,524
or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.

58
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,681
And it's similar with new technologies.

59
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:40,863
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,

60
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:43,393
these kids were showing that they were really fluent

61
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:45,066
with new technologies.

62
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,831
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,

63
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,527
because a lot of times people feel that

64
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,927
young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.

65
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:58,388
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."

66
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:02,185
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.

67
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,686
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.

68
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,239
When you really look at it, how is it that young people

69
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,775
spend most of their time using new technologies?

70
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:15,298
You often see them in situations like this,

71
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,492
or like this,

72
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,010
and there's no doubt that young people

73
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,326
are very comfortable and familiar browsing

74
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:26,848
and chatting and texting and gaming.

75
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:30,047
But that doesn't really make you fluent.

76
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:34,006
So young people today have lots of experience
and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,

77
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:41,206
but a lot less so of creating with new technologies

78
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,178
and expressing themselves with new technologies.

79
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:46,570
It's almost as if they can read

80
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,903
but not write with new technologies.

81
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:53,801
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent
so they can write with new technologies?

82
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,690
And that really means that they need to be able to

83
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,202
write their own computer programs, or code.

84
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,914
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize

85
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:10,218
the importance of learning to code.

86
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,820
You know, in recent years, there have been

87
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,712
hundreds of new organizations and websites

88
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:19,006
that are helping young people learn to code.

89
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,597
You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy

90
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:24,968
and events like CoderDojo

91
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,399
and sites like Girls Who Code,

92
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,093
or Black Girls Code.

93
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,201
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.

94
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,784
You know, just at the beginning of this year,
at the turn of the new year,

95
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,809
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

96
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,069
made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn

97
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,848
to code in 2012.

98
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:47,016
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that

99
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:50,672
all of its first graders should learn to code.

100
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:53,464
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.

101
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:57,773
about whether all the children there should learn to code.

102
00:05:57,773 --> 00:06:00,616
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,
it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.

103
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,374
When many people think of coding, they think of it

104
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:10,950
as something that only a very narrow sub-community
of people are going to be doing,

105
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:16,530
and they think of coding looking like this.
And in fact, if this is what coding is like,

106
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,191
it will only be a narrow sub-community of people
with special mathematical skills and technological background

107
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,529
that can code.

108
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,029
But coding doesn't have to be like this.

109
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:33,008
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.

110
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:37,287
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.

111
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,202
In this case, you take a move block,

112
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:40,971
snap it into a stack,

113
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,729
and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors

114
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,247
of the different characters in your game or your story,

115
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,548
in this case controlling the big fish.

116
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,999
After you've created your program, you can click on "share,"

117
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,075
and then share your project with other people,
so that they can use the project

118
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,872
and start working on the project as well.

119
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:04,194
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing

120
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,839
you can do with Scratch.

121
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,819
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,

122
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,643
there's everything from animated stories
to school science projects

123
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,123
to anime soap operas
to virtual construction kits

124
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:20,158
to recreations of classic video games

125
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,427
to political opinion polls

126
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,067
to trigonometry tutorials

127
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,987
to interactive artwork, and, yes,

128
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,771
interactive Mother's Day cards.

129
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,807
So I think there's so many different ways

130
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:37,267
that people can express themselves using this,

131
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,667
to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.

132
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,229
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.

133
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,996
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.

134
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,475
Here's an example from Hong Kong,

135
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,882
where some kids made a game

136
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:54,163
and then built their own physical interface device

137
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:57,055
and had a light sensor, so the light sensor

138
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,998
detects the hole in the board,

139
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:01,198
so as they move the physical saw,

140
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,438
the light sensor detects the hole

141
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:06,394
and controls the virtual saw on the screen

142
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:09,174
and saws down the tree.

143
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:11,283
We're going to continue to look at new ways

144
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,339
of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world

145
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,267
and connecting to the world around us.

146
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,500
This is an example from a new version of Scratch

147
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,123
that we'll be releasing in the next few months,

148
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,173
and we're looking again to be able

149
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:26,869
to push you in new directions.

150
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,133
Here's an example.
It uses the webcam.

151
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:38,063
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons

152
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,948
or I can move the bug.

153
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:43,513
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,

154
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:46,229
where you interact with gestures in the world.

155
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:48,473
But instead of just playing someone else's game,
you get to create the games,

156
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:52,098
and if you see someone else's game,
you can just say "see inside,"

157
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:57,632
and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,

158
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,308
and then, if there's so much video motion,

159
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,687
it will then tell the balloon to pop.

160
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:10,071
The same way that this uses the camera

161
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,576
to get information into Scratch,

162
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:15,583
you can also use the microphone.

163
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,567
Here's an example of a project using the microphone.

164
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,967
So I'm going to let all of you control this game

165
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,213
using your voices.

166
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:40,669
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)

167
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:49,298
(Laughter)

168
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:58,082
(Applause)

169
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:00,687
As kids are creating projects like this,

170
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,952
they're learning to code,

171
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:06,886
but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.

172
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:09,175
Because as they learn to code,

173
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,495
it enables them to learn many other things,

174
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,367
opens up many new opportunities for learning.

175
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:19,751
Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.

176
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,691
When you learn to read and write, it opens up

177
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:25,751
opportunities for you to learn so many other things.

178
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,511
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

179
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,699
And it's the same thing with coding.

180
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,246
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.

181
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:36,800
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.

182
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,298
You learn more about how computers work.

183
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,616
But that's just where it starts.

184
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:44,211
When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn

185
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,456
many other things.

186
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,802
Let me show you an example.

187
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,072
Here's another project,

188
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:53,340
and I saw this when I was visiting

189
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,482
one of the computer clubhouses.
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start

190
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:01,264
that help young people from low-income communities

191
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:05,343
learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.

192
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,138
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,

193
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:11,863
I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software

194
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,759
to create a game somewhat like this one,

195
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,682
and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,

196
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:20,647
but also he wanted to do more.

197
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,951
He wanted to keep score.

198
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,027
So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,

199
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:28,954
but he wanted to keep score, so that each time
the big fish eats the little fish,

200
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,871
the score would go up and it would keep track,

201
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,383
and he didn't know how to do that.

202
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,648
So I showed him.

203
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:43,225
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.

204
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:47,352
I'll call it score.

205
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:50,183
And that creates some new blocks for you,

206
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:54,849
and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,

207
00:11:54,849 --> 00:12:00,101
so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.

208
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,626
So I showed this to the clubhouse member --

209
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:05,327
let's call him Victor -- and Victor,

210
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:08,129
when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,

211
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,945
he knew exactly what to do.

212
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,259
He took the block

213
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:15,303
and he put it into the program

214
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:19,496
exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.

215
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:24,519
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,

216
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:30,514
he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.

217
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,211
And it's in fact working.

218
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,465
And he saw this, and he was so excited,

219
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,144
he reached his hand out to me,

220
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:38,693
and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

221
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,762
And what went through my mind was,

222
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,804
how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students

223
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,207
for teaching them variables? (Laughter)

224
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:49,688
It doesn't happen in most classrooms,

225
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:52,647
but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,

226
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,155
they don't know why they're learning it.
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.

227
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,188
When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,

228
00:13:00,188 --> 00:13:04,291
you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,

229
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,281
that you can understand the reason for learning variables,
and we see that kids learn it more deeply

230
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,738
and learn it better.

231
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:13,779
Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,
but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.

232
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,250
Now he had a reason for learning variables.

233
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,324
So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,

234
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:26,208
you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.

235
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,663
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,

236
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:32,447
they're learning important concepts like variables,

237
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,575
but that's just the start.

238
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:38,425
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,
he was also learning about the process of design,

239
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:44,296
how to start with the glimmer of an idea

240
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:47,202
and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project

241
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,709
like you see here.

242
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,749
So he was learning many different core principles of design,

243
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,991
about how to experiment with new ideas,

244
00:13:56,991 --> 00:14:01,696
how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,

245
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:04,686
how to collaborate with other people on your projects,

246
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:08,137
about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,
how to keep persistent and to persevere

247
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:14,596
in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.

248
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:16,369
Now those are important skills

249
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:19,237
that aren't just relevant for coding.
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.

250
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:25,232
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become

251
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,156
a programmer or a professional computer scientist?

252
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,968
It's probably not so likely,

253
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,756
but regardless of what he does,

254
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:35,460
he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.

255
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,044
Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager

256
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,164
or a mechanic or a community organizer,

257
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,620
that these ideas are useful for everybody.

258
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,542
Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.

259
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,898
When you become fluent with reading and writing,

260
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:54,339
it's not something that you're doing

261
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,299
just to become a professional writer.
Very few people become professional writers.

262
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:02,564
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.

263
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,659
Again, the same thing with coding.

264
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,881
Most people won't grow up to become professional

265
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:10,100
computer scientists or programmers,

266
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,438
but those skills of thinking creatively,

267
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,952
reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --

268
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,662
skills you develop when you code in Scratch --

269
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:22,484
are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.

270
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,860
And it's not just about your work life.

271
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,580
Coding can also enable you to

272
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,756
express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.
Let me end with just one more example.

273
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,556
So this is an example that came from

274
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:41,024
after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,

275
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:44,125
she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.

276
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,156
So she made this project for my birthday

277
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:50,732
and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.

278
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,588
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,

279
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,563
and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom

280
00:15:57,563 --> 00:16:01,800
is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.

281
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,772
But working on this project enabled her

282
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:07,438
to make a connection to someone that she cares about
and enabled her to keep on learning new things

283
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,678
and continuing to practice her creativity

284
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:15,853
and developing new ways of expressing herself.

285
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:20,064
So as we take a look and we see that

286
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,628
Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,

287
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,278
all of the children of Estonia learn to code,

288
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,478
even my mom has learned to code,
don't you think it's about time that you might be

289
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,162
thinking about learning to code?

290
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:33,355
If you're interested in giving it a try,

291
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:35,791
I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.

292
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,816
It's scratch.mit.edu,

293
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,638
and give a try at coding.

294
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:43,756
Thanks very much. (Applause)
