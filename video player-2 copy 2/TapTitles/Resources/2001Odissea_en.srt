1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:07,174
Dave, do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,551
No, not at all.

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,847
I’ve wondered whether
you might be having some

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,474
second thoughts about
the mission.

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,023
How do you mean?

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,152
Rumours about something
being dug up on the moon.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,742
I never gave these
stories much credence.

8
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,369
But, particularly
in view of some of the

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,955
other things that
have happened...

10
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,666
I find them difficult
to put out of my mind.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,293
[eerie tone]

12
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,590
Open the pod bay doors
please, HAL.

13
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,427
Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

14
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,639
I’m sorry, Dave.

15
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,016
 I’m afraid I can’t do that.

16
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,727
What are you talking
about, HAL?

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,816
This conversation can
serve no purpose anymore.

18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,775
Goodbye.

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:13,782
[eerie tone]

20
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:24,876
[eerie tone continues]

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:44,229
[music crecendos]

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,902
[triumphant music]

23
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:07,669
[triumphant music continues]
